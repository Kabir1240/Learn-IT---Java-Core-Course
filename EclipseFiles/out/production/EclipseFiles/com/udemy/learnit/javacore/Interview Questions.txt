My answers to OOP questions In Udemy Course:

Q1: What is OOP?
-> OOP, or object oriented programming, as the name suggests is a coding methodology which heavily
relies on Objects. Instead of executing code line by line, OOP can be used to create instances
and execute code from various classes. 

correct answer:
OOP is a programming methodology based on the representation of a software product as a collection
of objects, each of which is an instance of a particular class. Object takes the main place in 
this software design approach. Object can be described as data structure (some state) plus some 
behavior to modify and interact with this data (state). OOP uses the interaction of objects as its
basic elements.

Q2: What is an object?
-> An object is essentially a data structure. It is an instance of a class, which acts as the
blueprint for each instance. An object will inherit all of the attributes and behaviors of its
class, but may vary from instance to instance, in terms of what it contains.

Correct Answer:
An object is a named model of a real entity that has specific property values and manifests its 
behavior. Object has a set of data (fields and properties of an object) that is physically 
located in the computer's memory. Also, object has methods that have access to the data (fields 
and properties). An object is a concrete instance of a class.

Q3: Name the basic principles of OOP:
->
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
